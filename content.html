        Activated by ruangrupa’s invocation for Documenta 15, <span class="italic">lumbung</span>, which translates from
        Indonesian to a "communal rice barn", we sought to extend the narrative theme of collective sharing and
        nourishment to the public. Our goal was to cultivate a community of artists from varied
        lived experiences and cultural contexts, to provide a platform for their stories to be shared with the audiences
        of Documenta in Kassel, Germany.

      <p>
        We asked for submissions which engage critically with immigration and the global refugee
        crisis: from those traveling north from Central and South America, to citizens from Ukraine seeking refuge from
        the recent Russian invasion, to those relocating to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa, and beyond. We
        encouraged submissions from people affected by these situations, as well as those who work in solidarity with
        marginalized peoples of the world.

          Since 2015, three million people have fled the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. While the nation
          suffers, the political myth of fairly managing the wealth of the nation is far from the truth. The symbols on
          the
          Venezuelan crest depict national achievements and a utopian dream: a cornucopia of plenty, a bountiful
          harvest,
          and the unity of nation. This inheritance of wealth is tarnished with corruption in a country where crime and
          poverty continues to rise. People have to leave in order to find clean water, food, and medicine.

        <p class="offset">
          The government
          and other people in power are too greedy to admit the failed governance that sent the country into an economic
          crisis. The original crest depicts a horse, which represents independence. The new, colorless crest in my
          animation depicts a horse escaping from the center of the crest, representing the people who have fled the
          harsh
          conditions of contemporary Venezuela.

        <p class="italic">I was interested in the introduction of a man-made object in an outdoor setting, a
          white cube, a human element that forms a relationship with nature and helps it to be born again. From this, I
          feel a kind of storytelling blossom in these alternative landscapes; like a recurrent canvas that symbolically
          references creation, the picture or a full cliche space that needs to be recreated.
          <br>
          <br>
          The whole thing is done in an
          empirical way, and is guided by a formal research which was both meticulous and demanding. These alternative
          landscapes offer a new reading of the potential nature of its conventional forms and its given concept of life
          and intricacy.
        </p>
        <p class="italic">
          To others, it may seem as an irony but my approach towards landscape is to incorporate a poetic
          component that will trigger an emotional response linked to the abstraction of the form and color of the cube
          with the form and color of nature.
          <br>
          <br>
          I wanted to create something that was not a cliche and popular landscape but rather
          something engineered and designed, so as to move the viewer in a different way. Furthermore, the moving white
          cube of these series according to the condition of placing in frame, may seem as a solid and heavy form or a
          playful and living creature flowing in places.

          where - after a big celebratory “last dance” - they will be forced into becoming the seeds
          for a new generation.
          “Retornar” was made through a multilayered process. The world itself was built through a mixture of scenes
          created
          in The Sims 4, SketchUp, Photoshop, as well as real footage shot in front of a green screen. The scenarios
          were
          built using an isometric perspective to mimic early 8 bit video games, as well as early life simulation games,
          and
          videochat universes.

          <p>
            undocumenta was a joint project between <a href="https://graysonearle.com">Grayson Earle</a>, <a
              href="https://bozo.services">Tee
              Topor</a>, and <a href="">Chris Rogy</a>. The three met as members of The
            Illuminator art collective based in New York City. <a href="https://theilluminator.org">The Illuminator</a>
            is a
            guerrilla video projection collective that
            projects images, videos, and texts of protest on site-specific architecture around the world.
          </p>

          <p>
            This project is the premier intervention of a new Berlin-based project, Werde Sein. It takes its name from
            the
            immortal words of Rosa Luxemburg who said «Ich war, ich bin, ich werde sein», or "I was, I am, I shall be"
          </p>

          <p>
            We would like to thank Emily Andersen, Irma Trommer, and Anja Kellner without whom this project would not
            have
            been possible.
          </p>

          <p>
            undocumenta is aligned with the voices and struggles of the people, using technology as a mechanism to
            disrupt
            extractive, unequal capitalist regimes and amplify the grievances of the global 99%.
