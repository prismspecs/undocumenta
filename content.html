      undocumenta
    </h2>

    <p>
      Activated by ruangrupaâ€™s invocation for Documenta 15, <span class="italic">lumbung</span>, which translates from
      Indonesian to a "communal rice barn", we sought to extend the narrative theme of collective sharing and
      nourishment to the public. Our goal was to cultivate a community of artists and non-artists alike, from varied
      lived experiences and cultural contexts, and provide a platform for their stories to be shared with the audiences
      of Documenta in Kassel, Germany.
    </p>

    <p>
      We asked for submissions from people whose work engages critically with the global immigration policy and refugee
      crisis: from those traveling north from Central and South America, to citizens from Ukraine seeking refuge from
      the recent Russian invasion, to those relocating to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa, and beyond. We
      encouraged submissions from people affected by these situations, as well as those who work in solidarity with
      marginalized peoples of the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the following pages you will see inspiring works spanning various media including interactive video games,
      handwritten letters, photographs, video essays, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      undocumenta is aligned with the voices and struggles of the people, using technology as a mechanism to disrupt
      extractive, unequal capitalist regimes and amplify the grievances of the global 99%.
