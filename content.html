    </h2>

    <p>
      Activated by ruangrupa’s invocation for Documenta 15, <span class="italic">lumbung</span>, which translates from
      Indonesian to a "communal rice barn", we sought to extend the narrative theme of collective sharing and
      nourishment to the public. Our goal was to cultivate a community of artists and non-artists alike, from varied
      lived experiences and cultural contexts, and provide a platform for their stories to be shared with the audiences
      of Documenta in Kassel, Germany.
    </p>

    <p>
      We asked for submissions from people whose work engages critically with the global immigration policy and refugee
      crisis: from those traveling north from Central and South America, to citizens from Ukraine seeking refuge from
      the recent Russian invasion, to those relocating to Europe from the Middle East and North Africa, and beyond. We
      encouraged submissions from people affected by these situations, as well as those who work in solidarity with
      marginalized peoples of the world.
    </p>

    <p>
      In the following pages you will see inspiring works spanning various media including interactive video games,
      handwritten letters, photographs, video essays, and more.
    </p>

    <p>
      undocumenta is aligned with the voices and struggles of the people, using technology as a mechanism to disrupt
      extractive, unequal capitalist regimes and amplify the grievances of the global 99%.

    <p>
      Since 2015, three million people have fled the economic and political crisis in Venezuela. While the nation
      suffers, the political myth of fairly managing the wealth of the nation is far from the truth. The symbols on the
      Venezuelan crest depict national achievements and a utopian dream: a cornucopia of plenty, a bountiful harvest,
      and the unity of nation. This inheritance of wealth is tarnished with corruption in a country where crime and
      poverty continues to rise. People have to leave in order to find clean water, food, and medicine. The government
      and other people in power are too greedy to admit the failed governance that sent the country into an economic
      crisis. The original crest depicts a horse, which represents independence. The new, colorless crest in my
      animation depicts a horse escaping from the center of the crest, representing the people who have fled the harsh
      conditions of contemporary Venezuela.

      Kassel’s gps coordinates are the framework for the video: 51° 18’ 46.0836” North - 9° | 28’ 53.5584” East. The
      piece explores a collective passage from tram to tram stop; from the city outskirts to center, from the
      Wilhelmshöhe monument to the Nordstadt neighborhood. The video is a community's abstract itinerary and a migrant's
      metaphysical compass. It explores alternative histories of the city through text, color and sound. Bubbling
      mercurial waters speak to intimate archaeologies, immigration stories, and our collective desires: we anticipate a
      journey through a spectrum of colors while we imagine and create our futures.

    <p style="font-style:italic;">I was interested in the introduction of a man-made object in an outdoor setting, a
      white cube, a human element that forms a relationship with nature and helps it to be born again. From this, I feel
      a kind of storytelling blossom in these alternative landscapes; like a recurrent canvas that symbolically
      references creation, the picture or a full cliche space that needs to be recreated.The whole thing is done in an
      empirical way, and is guided by a formal research which was both meticulous and demanding. These alternative
      landscapes offer a new reading of the potential nature of its conventional forms and its given concept of life and
      intricacy.To others, it may seem as an irony but my approach towards landscape is to incorporate a poetic
      component that will trigger an emotional response linked to the abstraction of the form and color of the cube with
      the form and color of nature. I wanted to create something that was not a cliche and popular landscape but rather
      something engineered and designed, so as to move the viewer in a different way.Furthermore, the moving white cube
      of these series according to the condition of placing in frame, may seem as a solid and heavy form or a playful
      and living creature flowing in places.</p>

    <h2>Retornar</h2>

    <p>
      Set in a fictional Andes in the year 2222 "Retornar" (Spanish. To return, to come back) narrates the story of the
      nine last living humans on Earth, and their journey towards a big "reset".

    </p>

    <p>

      Narratively structured as a video game, “Retornar” takes place in an eco-pessimistic world, where Latin America
      has nothing else to give: its soil has dried up and the atmosphere has become increasingly dangerous. After a big
      war driven by an extreme exploitation of natural resources, the surviving characters wander around a dystopian
      Andean landscape, aimlessly and alone, with no other purpose but to spend their day going through different
      “puzzles” and “loading screens”, until they are summoned by a mysterious blue orb that will transport them into a
      digital celestial world where - after a big celebratory “last dance” - they will be forced into becoming the seeds
      for a new generation.
    </p>
    <p>
      “Retornar” was made through a multilayered process. The world itself was built through a mixture of scenes created
      in The Sims 4, SketchUp, Photoshop, as well as real footage shot in front of a green screen. The scenarios were
      built using an isometric perspective to mimic early 8 bit video games, as well as early life simulation games, and
      videochat universes.
