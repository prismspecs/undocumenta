                    Activated by ruangrupa’s invocation for Documenta 15, <span class="italic">lumbung</span>, which
                    translates from Indonesian to a "communal rice barn", we sought to extend the narrative theme of
                    collective sharing and nourishment to the public. Our goal was to cultivate a community of artists
                    from varied lived experiences and cultural contexts, to provide a platform for their stories to be
                    shared with the audiences of Documenta in Kassel, Germany.
                </p>

                <p>
                    We asked for submissions which engage critically with immigration and the global refugee crisis:
                    from those traveling north from Central and South America, to citizens from Ukraine seeking refuge
                    from the recent Russian invasion, to those relocating to Europe from the Middle East and North
                    Africa, and beyond. We encouraged submissions from people affected by these situations, as well as
                    those who work in solidarity with marginalized peoples of the world.

                    Rose has a sensible and scientific approach to art. For a while she worked as a costume designer for

                    <p>I was interested in the introduction of a man-made object in an outdoor setting, a
                        white cube, a human element that forms a relationship with nature and helps it to be born again.
                        From this, I
                        feel a kind of storytelling blossom in these alternative landscapes; like a recurrent canvas

                        symbolically
                        references creation, the picture or a full cliche space that needs to be recreated.</p>
                    <p>The whole thing is done in an
                        empirical way, and is guided by a formal research which was both meticulous and demanding. These
                        alternative
                        landscapes offer a new reading of the potential nature of its conventional forms and its given
                        concept of life

                        To others, it may seem as an irony but my approach towards landscape is to incorporate a poetic
                        component that will trigger an emotional response linked to the abstraction of the form and
                        color of
                        the cube
                        with the form and color of nature.

                    <p>
                        I wanted to create something that was not a cliche and popular landscape but rather
                        something engineered and designed, so as to move the viewer in a different way. Furthermore, the
                        moving white
                        cube of these series according to the condition of placing in frame, may seem as a solid and
                        heavy
                        form or a
                        playful and living creature flowing in places.

                    3D software as an imaginative way to talk about our bodies. Disjointed or deformed bodies are
                    recurring elements in their 3D work, marking the fluidity of our identities and our perception of
                    ourselves. Faridani has exhibited their work in different venues and galleries in the United States

                <p>Set in a fictional Andes in the year 2222 "Retornar" (Spanish. To return, to come back) narrates the
                    story of
                    the
                    nine last living humans on Earth, and their journey towards a big "reset".</p>
                <p>
                    Narratively structured as a video game, “Retornar” takes place in an eco-pessimistic world, where
                    Latin
                    America
                    has nothing else to give: its soil has dried up and the atmosphere has become increasingly
                    dangerous.
                    After a big
                    war driven by an extreme exploitation of natural resources, the surviving characters wander around a
                    dystopian
                    Andean landscape, aimlessly and alone, with no other purpose but to spend their day going through
                    different
                    “puzzles” and “loading screens”, until they are summoned by a mysterious blue orb that will
                    transport them
                    into a
                    digital celestial world where - after a big celebratory “last dance” - they will be forced into
                    becoming the seeds
                    for a new generation.
                    “Retornar” was made through a multilayered process. The world itself was built through a mixture of
                    scenes
                    created
                    in The Sims 4, SketchUp, Photoshop, as well as real footage shot in front of a green screen. The
                    scenarios
                    were
                    built using an isometric perspective to mimic early 8 bit video games, as well as early life
                    simulation games,
                    and

                    We would like to thank Emily Andersen, Irma Trommer, and Anja Kellner without whom this project
                    would not
                    have
                    been possible.

                    undocumenta is aligned with the voices and struggles of the people, using technology as a mechanism
                    to
                    disrupt
                    extractive, unequal capitalist regimes and amplify the grievances of the global 99%.
